Routing error:
Go to routes.rb in the config folder and check that 'users' has been correctly routed depending on whether it is a static page or not. I would then check the 'users' model to determine that it has been defined

NoMethodError:
I would go to the Questions controller inside 'app/controllers' here I would check that 'index' has been defined and then check for the 'answers' method inside the 'index'.
